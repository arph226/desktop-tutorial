This repository was created in Lab 7 to explore Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop. In this lab I learned how to create and manage repositories, manage pull requests, and collaborate using GitDesktop. I also learned the difference between the three different programs. 

Three programs are used in this lab: Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop. Git is a software which runs in the background of my PC and is accessed through a command window which is often confusing and difficult to use. GitHub Desktop is used to manage these comands and thier requests in a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This is helpful for version control of your code, and it allows for easier collaboration. Additionally, GitHub is a cloud based storage platform which is helpful for collaboration. Git is most valuable when you are working on complex codes and need access to branching, merging, commits, and the command window. GitHub Desktop is helpful when you want a visually appealing, easier way to commit, push, and pull and for managing multiple repositories. You should use GitHub when you need to store code online for collaboration in teams. 

Overall, learning these tools is essential when learning how to effectively code and share code in members of a team. In this lab, I learned how to effectively use all three of these programs and when it is best to use them. I understand the need for version control when making complex assignments and cloud-based programs for collaboration. This is helpful for future coding projects.
